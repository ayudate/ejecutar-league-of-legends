gwin version info to cygcheck.cc  To: cygwin-developers at sourceware dot cygnus dot com Subject: Added cygwin version info to cygcheck.cc From: Chris Faylor &lt;cgf at cygnus dot com> Date: Sat, 24 Jun 2000 23:23:46 -0400 Reply-To: cygwin-developers at sourceware dot cygnus dot com I just checked in a change that adds cygwin version info to cygcheck output.  When cygcheck finds a DLL named "cygwin1.dll" it attempts to read version info from the file.  If it fails then nothing is printed. Otherwise the output looks like this:   6494k 2000/06/25 f:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll     Cygwin DLL version info:         dll major: 1001         dll minor: 3         dll epoch: 19         dll bad signal mask: 19005         dll old termios: 5         api major: 0         api minor: 22         shared data: 3         dll identifier: cygwin1         mount registry: 2         cygnus registry name: Cygnus Solutions         cygwin registry name: Cygwin         program options name: Program Options         cygwin mount registry name: mounts v2         build date: Sat Jun 24 20:46:08 EDT 2000         shared id: cygwin1S3-2000-06-24 20:46  I've also modified cygcheck so that cygwin1.dll info is always printed last when doing a 'cygcheck -s'.  I'm not 100% satisfied with the way the output looks but I can't think of anything better than this.  This is just a dumping of the strings that are in the DLL.  If anyone wants to patch cygcheck.cc to make this more visually appealing somehow, feel free.  cgf
